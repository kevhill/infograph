# Infograph
A cryptography protected protocol for transmitting information in a distributed system. Uses central authorities or web of trust to achieve high efficiency. The core is a light meta-data schema wrapping a byte blob. That should make it sound pretty boring, but using the right meta-data enables us to construct a decentralized belief system that can either enforce convergence through centralized authorities or allow for non-convergance using a web of trust.

## Why
Modern technology is getting better and better at creating fake content. We have the ability to create fake photo-realistic people, make real people with enough video say anything we want, and soon the ability to overlay computer generated content onto the real world. This poses a fundamental problem to our modern information age. What we need is a way to determine the source and veracity of information at massive scales.

In order to solve this problem, there are three basic needs. First, the protocol must include something that we do not believe possible of faking. Second, it must be open protocol to prevent rent seaking behavior limiting the impact of the protocol. Third, it must be reasonably computationally efficient to prevent barriers to spreading information. While blockchain fullfils the first 2 requirements, the underlying proof-of-work model is fundamentally inefficient. This means a new protocol must be invented to serve as a primary means of transmitting information across the globe.

There are two other forms of traditional trust however that are traditional because they are highly efficient. Centralized authority and web-of-trust. Centralized authority assumes there are some small number of trusted brokers of information. Governments are a perfect example of this, where moderate levels of distribution at the local and state level, and increasing levels of centralized belief at the federal level. Web-of-trust was originally formalized to deal with distributing public keys, but models a much more ancient form of moving information across groups of individuals. Both have secondary strengths and weaknesses, and so we wish to design a protocol able to encompass either trust framework.
